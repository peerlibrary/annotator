# This anhor type stores information about a piece of text,
# described using the actual reference to the range in the DOM.
#
# When creating this kind of anchor, you are supposed to pass
# in a NormalizedRange object, which should cover exactly
# the wanted piece of text; no character offset correction is supported.
#
# Also, please note that these anchors can not really be virtualized,
# because they don't have any truly DOM-independent information;
# the core information stored is the reference to an object which
# lives in the DOM. Therefore, no lazy loading is possible with
# this kind of anchor. For that, use TextPositionAnchor instead.
#
# This plugin also adds a strategy to reanchor based on range selectors.
# If the TextQuote plugin is also loaded, then it will also check
# the saved quote against what is available now.
#
# If the TextPosition plugin is loaded, it will create a TextPosition
# anchor; otherwise it will record a TextRangeAnchor.
